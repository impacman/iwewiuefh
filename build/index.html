  11. 1. Each Receiving Party covenants and agrees that:<br>

  11.1.1. It will hold all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in trust and the strictest confidence, and
  protect it in accordance with a standard of care which shall be no less than the care it uses to protect its own
  information of like importance but in no event with less than reasonable care. This shall include, but not be
  limited to, using all reasonable endeavours to effect and maintain adequate security measures to safeguard such
  Confidential Information from unauthorized access, use and misappropriation;<br>
  11.1.2. It will not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose other than the sole
  purpose for which the Disclosing Party provided such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party;<br>
  11.1.3. It will not use, copy, or disclose, or permit any unauthorized person access to, any Confidential
  Information belonging to the Disclosing Party or any third party; except that the Receiving Party may disclose
  Confidential <br>Information of the Disclosing Party to its Representatives, provided such Representatives (i) have
  a need to know such Confidential Information, and (ii) such Representatives are informed, directed, and obligated by
  the Receiving Party to treat such Confidential Information in accordance with the obligations of this Agreement. The
  Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach of an obligation hereunder by any of its Representatives;
  11.1.4. Upon the request of the Disclosing Party and in any event upon the termination of the relationship between
  the Parties, the Receiving Party will either (i) deliver to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information that
  is in the Receiving Party‚Äôs possession, whether made or compiled by the Receiving Party or furnished to the
  Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party, or (ii) with the written permission of the Disclosing Party, destroy all of
  the same and certify such destruction in writing to the Disclosing Party; and<br>

  license to the Confidential Information of either Party hereunder is implied or expressed by entering into this
  Agreement or disclosing such items hereunder to the Receiving Party.<br>

  Receiving Party and damages arising out of any such breach would be difficult to ascertain. The Receiving Party
  agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law or in equity, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled
  to injunctive relief in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any such covenants, and the Receiving Party
  hereby waives any requirement that the Disclosing Party post any bond in connection with obtaining such injunctive
  relief. Furthermore, in the event of a breach of such covenants, the Receiving Party agrees to pay all of the
  Disclosing Party‚Äôs costs, including (but not limited to) reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees, of enforcing such covenants.
  Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Disclosing Party from pursuing any other remedies available to
  it for such breach, including the recovery of damages from the Receiving Party.<br>
  11.2. The obligations of confidentiality in previous section shall not apply to:<br>
  11.2.1. Any information that: (i) is or becomes publicly known (other than as a result of a breach by the Receiving
  Party or its Representatives of this Agreement); (ii) is or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a
  third party, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Receiving Party or its
  Representatives, after reasonable investigation, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other
  contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (iii) is independently
  developed by the Receiving Party without violating the terms of this Agreement; or (iv) is known by the Receiving
  Party or its Representatives prior to its disclosure to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party. Failure to mark
  or indicate any of the Confidential Information as confidential shall not affect its status as Confidential
  Information under this Agreement.<br>
  11.2.2. Any Confidential Information required to be disclosed pursuant to a court order or other governmental or
  administrative decree of appropriate and sufficient jurisdiction requiring disclosure of such Confidential
  Information, provided that the Receiving Party shall (i) first give Disclosing Party prompt written notice prior to
  such disclosure in order to permit the Disclosing Party, at its expense, to seek a protective order, and (ii)
  cooperate with Disclosing Party in seeking a protective order. In the event that such protective order is not
  obtained or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving
  Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which, in the reasonable written opinion of
  legal counsel, is legally required to be disclosed and, upon the Disclosing Party‚Äôs request and at the Disclosing
  Party‚Äôs expense, will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be
  accorded to such information.<br>
  11.3. The Parties agree that while they have a business relationship, and for a period of two (2) years after
  termination of their relationship, they will not either alone or in association with others, directly or indirectly,
  induce any employee of or consultant to the other party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate such
  person's employment with such entity or cease such consultant's provision of services to such entity, and shall not,
  directly or indirectly, either individually or as owner, agent, employee, or otherwise, employ, engage or offer
  employment on behalf of any entity or any person who is or was employed by the other party or any of its
  subsidiaries or affiliates of the other party, unless such person shall have ceased to be employed by the other
  party or any such subsidiary or affiliate for a period of at least six (6) months.<br>
  11.4. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that:<br>
  11.4.1. The disclosure by it of any Confidential Information hereunder does not violate the rights of any other
  entity;<br>
  11.4.2. The provision of Confidential Information hereunder and any discussions held in connection with the
  potential business relationship shall not prevent either of the Parties from pursuing similar or other discussions
  with third parties. Any estimates, forecasts or similar material provided by either Party to the other shall not
  constitute any commitment.<br>
  11.4.3. The protection afforded hereunder is in addition to and does not replace any prior confidentiality or
  non-disclosure obligation of one Party to the other.<br><br>
  11.5. Each Party shall comply with all data protection and privacy regulations applicable to it in respect of any
  personally identifying information relating to any individual. If Executor receives/obtains/saves any personal data
  (as defined by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the
  protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data,
  and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)) Publisher shall (and ensure that its
  employees, contractors and agents shall) ensure that (i) Publisher fully complies with the provisions of the General
  Data Protection Regulation and/or any other applicable regulation; (ii) only deal with the data to fulfill
  Publishers obligations under this document and (iii) shall not use such personal data except as expressly authorized
  by the individual. Publisher shall indemnify and keep Advertiser indemnified for any breach of the General Data
  Protection Regulation or any other data protection and privacy regulations which renders Advertiser liable for any
  costs, claims, fines, or expenses, howsoever arising.<br><br>

  12. <b>Non-Disparagement</b><br><br>
  12.1. Publisher agrees not to engage in any conduct that is injurious to the reputation of the Advertiser and/or its
  affiliates, officers and directors or making or causing to be made any statement that is critical of or otherwise
  maligns the business reputation of the Advertiser and/or its affiliates, officers and directors. Publisher
  acknowledge that breaching of this notice will cause the Advertiser to incur substantial economic damages and losses
  of types and in amounts which are impossible to compute and ascertain with certainty as a basis for recovery by the
  Advertiser of actual damages, and that liquidated damages represent a fair, reasonable and appropriate estimate
  thereof.<br>
  12.2. Accordingly, in lieu of actual damages for such breach, Publisher agrees that liquidated damages may be
  assessed and recovered by the Advertiser against Publisher, in the event of each breach and without the Advertiser
  being required to present any evidence of the amount or character of actual damages sustained by reason thereof;
  therefore Publisher shall be liable to the Advertiser for payment of liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages are
  intended to represent estimated actual damages and are not intended as a penalty, and Publisher shall pay them to
  Advertiser without limiting Company`s right to seek other remedies as provided elsewhere herein.<br></div>
